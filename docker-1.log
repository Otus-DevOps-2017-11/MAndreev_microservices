docker inspect <u_container_id> - show information about container*
docker inspect <u_image_id> - show information about image

*now can use docker container inspect; docker container command for manage containers only

docker container inspect show full information about container:
- Id, Create date, Start date, Current status, Image ID, Platform, Start config and params, Networks, Volumes, Diffs from other layers, etc so it is low-level information about container
docker image inspect show full information about image:
- Id, Repo, Create date, Author, Config (envs/args/workdir/exposed potrs/cmd - all info what was in Dockerfile), Author, Layers and diffs
